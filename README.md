# Development

## Prerequisites

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) *(Windows only)*

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository locally.
2. Clone the [ietf-tools/datatracker](https://github.com/ietf-tools/datatracker) repository into another directory. Check out the `feat/rpc-api` branch, start the Docker environment, and start the dev server.
3. [Obtain an xfer database dump](#obtain-an-xfer-database-dump) *(optional, and not generally available)*
4. Continue using the steps for your preferred IDE:
   - [Visual Studio Code](#using-vs-code)
   - [Generic](#using-generic)
5. [Create demo data](#create-demo-data) if you have not already

## Obtain an xfer Database Dump
This step is required if you need a populated database to work with. In addition to the steps here, the datatracker's database needs to be populated with a compatible dataset. Instructions for that are TBD.

1. Open a shell _on the host_ (not in the docker container) and navigate to the project root directory.
2. Run `./refresh_xfer_dump.sh`. This will prompt you to authenticate with Azure and download the most recent xfer dump.

To return to an empty DB as a starting point, remove the `purple.dump` and rebuild your docker environment.

## Using VS Code

1. Open the project in VS Code
2. When prompted, in the lower right corner, click <kbd>Reopen in container</kbd>
3. Wait for the devcontainer to initialize. *(This can take a few seconds/minutes the first time)*
4. The editor will automatically open 2 side-by-side terminals, running both the backend API server and the client dev server.
5. Open http://localhost:8088 in your browser and login using some Datatracker user.
6. If there are login problems try configuring VSCode's 'Remote: Local Port Host' to 'allInterfaces' and then reopen VSCode's devcontainers.

## Using Generic

1. In a terminal, from the project root folder, run the command:
    ```sh
    docker/run
    ```
2. Wait for the containers to initialize. *(This can take a few seconds/minutes the first time)*
3. A tmux session will automatically be started with the backend API server running on the left and the client dev server running on the right.
4. Open http://localhost:8088 in your browser and login using some Datatracker user.

#### Tips

- The tmux default prefix binding is set to `Ctrl+Space` and mouse control is enabled by default.
- If you exit tmux, you'll land in a normal zsh prompt. Type `exit` again to quit and stop the containers.

## Using MailHog

Emails sentout from dev enviroment is caught by [Mailpit](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit).
Access Mailpit from http://localhost:8025/

## Using pgAdmin

- Access pg Admin from http://localhost:8088/pgadmin/
- Username: `dev@ietf.org`
- Password: `dev`
- Password to access the local database: `abcd1234`

## Commands

#### Django Backend API (`/workspace`)

- Start Server: `./manage.py runserver 8001`

#### Nuxt Client (`/workspace/client`)

- Run Dev Server: `npm run dev`
- Generate Production Build: `npm run build`

## Using rfced-xfer data

### Obtaining or updating a database dump

To obtain or update your rfced-xfer database dump, on the host (i.e., _outside_ the docker container) run
```sh
./refresh_xfer_dump.sh
```
This will prompt you to log in to Azure if necessary, then download the latest xfer dump.

### Loading a new database dump

After obtaining the new database dump, on the host (i.e., _outside_ the docker container), run
```sh
./rebuild_db_container.sh
```
This will destroy your db container and its data, then build a new one using the dump found in `purple.dump`. If there is no such file, an empty database will be created.

### Returning to an empty database

To start over with an empty database after using an rfced-xfer dump
1. Remove the file `purple.dump`
2. Follow the steps to [load a new database dump](#loading-a-new-database-dump)
3. Restart your docker environment or run `./manage.py migrate` in your app container.

## Create demo data

To create demo data, open an app container shell and run the management command
```sh
./manage.py create_rpc_demo
```
This requires that the Datatracker dev server be running.

To remove all data and start afresh, you can run
```sh
./manage.py purge --yes-im-sure
```
and all data in the RPC tool's database will be reset. The Datatracker _will not_ be reset, but running `create_rpc_demo` again will work as intended.

## APIs

This project uses two distinct HTTP APIs. Both are accessed using clients generated from OpenAPI specifications. The clients are generated using [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/).

### Front-end to Back-end: `purple_api`

This API is used by the Nuxt Client front end to communicate with the Django back end. This API is defined by this project through an OpenAPI specification in `purple_api.yaml`. The API is implemented using the `django-rest-framework` and the spec is generated using `drf-spectacular`.

### Back-end to Datatracker: `rpcapi`

This API is used by the Django back end to communicate with the Datatracker. It is implemented in the Datatracker code and described (as of Jan 2024) by a hand-written OpenAPI spec in `rpcapi.yaml`. The current version of the spec is fetched from the Datatracker's `feat/rpc-api` branch when starting this project's Docker environment. If the API is updated on the Datatracker side, you must manually copy the new `rpcapi.yaml` into the root of this project and update the clients as described in the next section.

### Updating the API clients

If changes are made to the APIs, you will need to update the clients. If this includes changes to the Datatracker's `rpcapi.yaml` file you must first copy the new version of that file into this project's root. Then, from inside this project's Docker shell, run
```sh
./update-rpcapi
```
This uses [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/) to regenerate `purple_api.yaml` and builds both the API clients. It may take a minute or two. When it is done, restart the Django dev server. The Nuxt server normally picks up the changes automatically.

## Cleanup

To fully tear down the containers created in either of the VS Code or Generic steps, run the following command from the project root folder:
```sh
docker/cleanall
```
Press <kbd>Y</kbd> to confirm.
