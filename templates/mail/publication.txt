        DOI:        10.17487/RFC9861

This document defines four eXtendable-Output Functions (XOFs), hash
functions with output of arbitrary length, named TurboSHAKE128,
TurboSHAKE256, KT128, and KT256.

All four functions provide efficient and secure hashing primitives,
and the last two are able to exploit the parallelism of the
implementation in a scalable way.

This document is a product of the Crypto Forum Research Group. It
builds up on the definitions of the permutations and of the sponge
construction in NIST FIPS 202 and is meant to serve as a stable
reference and an implementation guide.
